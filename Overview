Appendices for Sound and Ritualistic Language in Charles Williams War in Heaven

In this study, I uncover a link between sound patterns and ritualistic language in Charles Williams’ (1886-1945) first published novel, War in Heaven (1930), through an analysis of the relationship between quality of sound and content. 
Based on the evidence presented, I conclude that War in Heaven contains a significant correspondence between sound quality and ritual events, and that this correspondence actively contributes to Williams’ attempt to convey his experience of ritual magic through his novels. This study is intended to be a preliminary investigation and as such, there is scope for further research. It is intended to be an experiment in methodology as much as a proof of concept.
